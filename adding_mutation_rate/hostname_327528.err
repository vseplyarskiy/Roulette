distributed.scheduler.KilledWorker: Attempted to run task ('aggregate-chunk-c74e3a7baed221efa2913634bac51fa3-bf81dcd324aafe137e2e7dcbd32502d8', 0) on 3 different workers, but all those workers died while running it. The last worker that attempt to run the task was tcp://127.0.0.1:39425. Inspecting worker logs is often a good next step to diagnose what went wrong.
