<h1 align="center"> Population Genetics </h1>

This directory is for files related to population genetics simulations and analyses.

```SFS_observed_and_simulated.tsv.gz```, ```SFS_observed_and_simulated_highmut.tsv.gz```, ```SFS_observed_and_simulated_lowmut_new.tsv.gz``` are simulated SFS from the fitted population genetics simulation.

```demographic_sfs_analyses.ipynb``` is the jupyter notebook for creating figure 3.

```low_freq_assumption``` includes data and notebook used to test the porportion of low-frequency variants that are derived, not ancestral.

```high_rate_gene_context_comparison.ipynb``` is the jupyter notebook for validating the observed excess polymorphishm in IGK, RNU, and tRNA genes and analyzing the distribution of mutation rates within these genes. SNV an `de novo` data necessary to run this notebook can be downloaded [<img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7659046.svg">](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7659046)
