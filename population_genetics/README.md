This directory is for files related to population genetics simulations.

```SFS_observed_and_simulated.tsv.gz```, ```SFS_observed_and_simulated_highmut.tsv.gz```, ```SFS_observed_and_simulated_lowmut_new.tsv.gz``` are simulated SFS from the fitted population genetics simulation.

```demographic_sfs_analyses.ipynb``` is the jupyter notebook for creating figure 3.

```low_freq_assumption``` includes data and notebook used to test the porportion of low-frequency variants that are derived, not ancestral.
